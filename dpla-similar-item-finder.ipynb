    "I wanted to play around with the idea of making connections between items from different providers in DPLA.  Because Texas currently has two pathways to DPLA, I wanted to try to show the connections between the collections from each partner, and experiment with new kinds of serendipitous discovery in DPLA.  What if there was a way to take an item from one DPLA partner (like the Texas Digital Library) and find similar items from another partner (such as the Portal to Texas History)?\n",
    "\n",
    "This script uses the DPLA API to search for possibly similar items.  It asks for the ID for an item in DPLA, selects a random subject from that item, and then uses that subject term to search for possibly similar items.  I've scoped it to search specifically for items from the Portal to Texas History, but you can easily change that to another DPLA partner.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will return three randomly selected items, and also give you a link to see more in the DPLA portal."
