# dpla-similar-item-finder

Jupyter notebook that contains a python script that uses the DPLA API to search for similar items in [DPLA](https://dp.la).

Uses the [DPLA API](https://pro.dp.la/developers/api-codex) for interacting with DPLA dataset, and [DPyLA](https://github.com/bibliotechy/DPyLA/blob/master/README.md) for interacting with the api.

This is my first time using Jupyter notebooks, and only my second real project in Python. I'm sure there are things I could be doing differently/better, so please let me know if you have suggestions!

A lot of the inspiration for this project, and for the way it is presented, comes from the [GLAM Workbench project](https://glam-workbench.net/).
